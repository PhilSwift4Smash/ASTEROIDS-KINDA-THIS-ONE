ASTEROIDS KINDA is a version of "Asteroids" with several major changes that you may notice like:
1. You have a lifebar. It goes down constatly as long as you aren't doing anything. It also goes down with use of the laser minigun and pressing the down arrow.
2. Theese asteroids aren't normal asteroids! They have strange behaviors that may imply some sort of... master.
3. The weapons don't suck! Each Level has a unique weapon with completley different properties.
4. Music? This is copyright infringement! No, I made it. You can find the mp3 in the game's files, and test it against every other song in existence, and not find a one to
one comparison.
